│   We've detected your project is not fully setup with the new framework format, which was introduced in        │
│   Storybook 7.                                                                                                 │

│   Storybook 7 introduced the concept of frameworks, which abstracts configuration for renderers (e.g. React,   │
│   Vue), builders (e.g. Webpack, Vite) and defaults to make integrations easier.                                │

│   Here are the steps this migration will do to migrate your project:                                           │
│   - Remove the following dependencies:                                                                         │

│   - Add the following dependencies:                                                                            │
│   - * @storybook/react-webpack5                                                                                │

│   Unless you're using Storybook's Vite builder, this automigration will install a Webpack 5 based framework.   │
│                                                                                                                │
│   Given you were using Storybook's Webpack 4 builder (default in 6.x, discontinued in 7.0), this could be a    │
│   breaking change -- especially if your project has a custom webpack configuration.                            │
│                                                                                                                │

│   However, Storybook 8 changes this behavior, and we now recommend using the                 │
│   (fn) function to mock your component's methods instead.                                    │

│   npx storybook migrate find-implicit-spies --glob="**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"           │

The migration successfully updated your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.

It also ran the 'mdx-to-csf' codemod to convert your MDX stories to CSF format.
This codemod is not perfect however, so you may need to manually fix any issues it couldn't handle.
